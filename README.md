# Twitter-Data-Sentiment-Analysis

Project Description: In e-commerce, vendors could upload different images and product title for the same product. In order to help the customers find the products of their interests, it's necessary to find the matching items in the system.

As a team, we built a TFIDF-CNN model that considers both text and images. Our model smoothly met this demand.
